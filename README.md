# Simbot-Navigation-Agent-A-Dialog-Enabled-VLN-Framework
An implementation of a dialog-enabled agent for visual-language navigation (VLN) in a simulated 3D environment. The agent learns to follow natural language instructions and can ask clarifying questions when faced with ambiguity, inspired by the Alexa Prize Simbot challenge.
